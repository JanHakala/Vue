Learning to code Vue with uDemy course: **Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)** https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/
I have limited coding experience, mainly from a few trainings years ago - Basic and Borland Delphi Object Pascal =)
Recently, I've been self-studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at a beginner level. My goal is to learn Vue by building a workshop application for our workshop chain's needs.
